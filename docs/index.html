<br>On the 11th March 2020, The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic, causing anxiety and concern throughout the world.<br>

<br>Within the UK, a nationwide lockdown was announced by UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. These measures included only leaving the house for essentials and one form of exercise a day, avoiding small and large gatherings and working from home.<br>

<br>With the closure of all non-essential retail stores, entertainment and leisure industries suspending any event that doesn’t comply with social distancing, the UK has found itself in economic difficulties, with the government setting up a furlough scheme to support businesses.<br>

<br>However, as lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted, the greyhound industry appears to be the first of the leisure sector racing ahead in resuming.<br>

<br>With the Greyhound Board of Great Britain announcing that they hope to resume racing behind closed doors from 1st June adhering to government guidelines, how has the coronavirus affected those within the industry and what impact has it had on the future of greyhound racing?<br>

          <center><b>An employee at a greyhound racing stadium worries that the industry “will struggle to come back” after lockdown restrictions are lifted.</b></center><br>

      <br>Jack Bowen, who works at Monmore Green Stadium in Wolverhampton, said that he and his colleagues were wondering how they would be impacted and how the stadium would be impacted.<br>

      <br>Jack worked his last shift on 14th March 2020: “There were discussions beforehand of what we would do if the government decided to ban mass gatherings of a certain number of people.”<br>

      <br>The UK Government announced on 16th March 2020 that public gatherings of two or more people would be prohibited, unless a group of people lived together in the same household or for essential work purposes.<br>

      <br>Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), the regulators of licensed greyhound racing in the UK, announced on 18th March 2020 that they would be racing behind closed doors after they took the most recent advice from the government.<br>

      <br>They later suspended all greyhound racing entirely after Boris Johnson’s announcement to the public on 24th March 2020.<br>

          In a public update, Mark Bird, managing director of GBGB, said:<br></div>

          <br><div id="quote">“In responding to tonight’s PM’s announcement we have to suspend all racing tomorrow (24 March 2020) as this is the responsible thing to do, however there remains a need to clarify the government position in terms of ‘gatherings’ and ‘work’. I have contacted our contacts in Defra and DCMS and await their urgent clarification on these points. The GBGB has planned for this eventuality and we are ready to meet it head on. I firmly believe that the UK racing greyhound community are of the same stoic mind. Let’s remain calm and we will carry on.“</div><br>
        <div id="bodytext1">
          Jack is currently on the furlough scheme which was introduced by the government to help employers and employees during the coronavirus outbreak, paying the wages for over 900,000 businesses throughout the UK.<br>

            However, Jack has concerns for those who support the industry: “It is a very dedicated group of people, a very niche sport.
            From what I have seen at work, those  who bet and attend the races, who invest time and money into this industry, I hate to say it, are of an older
            generation who fall into the bracket of being high-risk during this pandemic”.<br>

            <br>The majority of COVID-19 related deaths in England and Wales have been among people aged 65 and over, with the
            highest number occurring in those ages 85 and over.<br>

            <br>Looking into the future of the industry, Jack said: “There is a lot of income that is being lost and I think it will be a
             very slow few months, if not years trying to get the industry back up on its feet to where it was before.<br></div>

      <center><b>The UK’s leading greyhound trainer hopes for the greyhound industry to “come out of the other side intact” once lockdown measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus are lifted.</b></centeR><br>

    <br>Mark Wallis, the UK’s leading greyhound trainer, has said that his business will take a financial hit, but if the industry resumes racing behind closed doors in June, his business will be able to keep going without too much damage.<br>
    <br>However, he says: “A second wave of the pandemic would be a disaster for sure.”<br>

<br>Mark Walls has won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year award for eight consecutive years and a record number of eleven times in total.<br>

<br>With the UK placed under lockdown, the government implemented measures of people only being able to leave their homes for basic necessities and medical reasons, and for one form of exercise a day. <br>

<br>When asked whether these lockdown measures were impacting the greyhounds in his care, Mark said: “It’s only the racing side that has really affected the dogs, they love their racing and you can tell they are missing it despite us giving them more time out in paddocks than normal and giving them extra walks and grooms.” <br>

<br>Mark currently trains around 55 dogs, with these numbers fluctuating at times. He says: “About 10 are top class dogs like Antigua Fire and Bumblebee Bullet who compete in the group 1 competitions around the country.” <br>

    <div id="bodytext1">Although not having difficulties with his usual day-to-day routines, Mark has lost around 40% of his income, including trainer contract money and prize money from racing the 15 dogs that he personally owns.<br>

<br>Luckily, Mark has been able to get financial help. He said: “We have received some financial help from the GBGB (£3.50 per dog per week) and from our promoter at Henlow, Kevin Boothby (£5 per dog per week). Both are a massive help to keeping our heads above water.<Br>

<br>“The GBGB have done their best to keep us informed of the current climate and their financial support has been invaluable, as has the owners support as well.” <br>

<br>Looking towards the future, Mark says: “I’ve no doubt the next few months will be a struggle for many people. But it’s a really big chance for the industry to showcase what a great and safe sport we have if they are one of the first to resume again.<br>

<br>“Many people’s perception of greyhound racing over the years has been shrouded by lies of cruelty of our beloved greyhounds, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. Many thousands that work in the industry love the sport and the greyhounds, just like myself and my staff do.”<br>

  <div id="title2">“We want racing to end but in a controlled manner” - greyhound welfare campaigner speaks about campaigning, research and COVID-19.</div>
  <hr>
  <div id="bodytext1">
    <b>Greyhound welfare campaigner speaks about her campaigning and research for Greyt Exploitations and her worries for greyhounds during COVID-19.</b><br>

    <br>Trudy Baker has been co-ordinator of Greyt Exploitations for 9 years, a non-profit organisation that: “Strives to raise the public’s awareness of the cruel and inhumane treatment of racing greyhounds.”<br>

    <br>Trudy first became concerned with the welfare of greyhounds in the industry after she attended a greyhound race and saw an accident on the track. When she approached the trackside vet on the condition of the dog, she said: “I was treated abruptly. I was told the dog would be fine and to move away.”<br>

    <br>It was shortly after this incident that she investigated further into the greyhound industry and discovered that she wanted to “expose the cruelty.<br>

    <br>“I asked somebody from the RSPCA how we can get rid of the industry and she said you have to expose it. Expose the cruelty, so that’s what we do. We conduct a lot of research and education, using information from the industry so it cannot be discredited by them.”<br>

    <br>To do this, Trudy worked with web designers and software engineers to create Greyt Exploitations, a database that included details of greyhounds involved in major track incidents and injuries from all Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) licensed tracks from 2005-2004.<br>

        </div>
</div>


<div class="slide ten">
  <div id="bodytext1">
    <br>Trudy said: “We wanted to use data that was verified by the GBGB so that they couldn’t discredit the information.”<br>

    <br>She added: “The database no longer works due to GBGB removing the information from their website.”<br>

    <br>Since 2017, GBGB began releasing their own data, including injuries, retirement and deaths, saying: “As the regulator for greyhound racing in Great Britain, we are responsible for the welfare of all registered racing greyhounds - from registration to retirement.”<br>

    <br>The most recent data shows that there were 4,963 total injuries in 2018.<br>

    <center><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/2653929" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2653929/embed" data-width="70%" data-height="400px"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div></center>

  <br>Despite the database no longer working on Greyt Exploitations, Trudy updates the site with resources and reports that she says: “Dismiss the propaganda and industry’s claims of ‘high welfare standards within a highly regulated sport’.”
        <div id="extra">Continued ▶</div>

<div class="slide twelve">
  <div id="bodytext1">
  <br>One of the <a href=”http://greytexploitations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Injuries-in-Racing-Greyhounds-by-AK.pdf”>reports</a> she highlighted was a commission by Greyt Exploitations to Professor Andrew Knight which revealed “the unavoidable injuries” that greyhounds face when racing on oval shaped tracks.<br>

  <br>The report says: “Curved tracks are hazardous because of the uneven forces that they create on greyhounds whilst negotiating bends. This places asymmetrical forces on limbs, increasing the loading of certain limbs.”<br>

  <br>The report also highlights the danger of congestion during the curves in the track, which increases the risk of collisions with other greyhounds at high speed.<br>

  <br>Trudy said: “We showed GBGB the report by Greyt Exploitations to give them the opportunity to discredit. We asked them ‘why don’t you race on straight tracks where the pressure would be more even on the dogs?’ But they never replied.<br>

  <br>“I believe it’s because the bookmakers don’t want straight tracks as it wouldn’t be as fun and wouldn’t bring in as much money into the industry.”<br>

  <br>She is now concerned with the welfare of the greyhounds during the coronavirus pandemic.<br>

  <br>Since the 23rd March, the UK introduced lockdown measures to minimise the spread and infection of COVID-19.<br>

  <br>These lockdown measures led to the greyhound industry racing “behind closed doors” and minimising the risk of infection to fans of the sport as well as the trainers.<br>

  <br>However, GBGB announced shortly after that all racing would be suspended.<br>

  <br>Trudy said: “They were lobbying parliament to continue racing behind closed doors, but we sent them a video showing that they couldn’t comply with government guidelines of social distancing.<br>

</div>
</div>

<div class="slide thirteen">
  <div id="bodytext1">
  <br>“Collecting the dogs where they finish the race, you have 6 loose dogs and 6 trainers trying to put leads and collars on dogs, it would be impossible to comply with the guidelines. Fortunately, the government told the industry no and that they would have to suspend all racing until they reviewed the lockdown measures.”<br>

  <br>She also has huge concerns that the dogs will suffer during the lockdown due to the loss of income for trainers and owners.<br>

  <br>GBGB initially announced on 24th March that they would be providing funds of 50p per day per dog for each trainer for greyhound and professional trainers to help pay for food and bedding.<br>

  <br>Having 3 dogs herself, Trudy said: “There is no way I could feed my dogs on 50p per day. You can’t feed them on that, it’s just not enough.”<Br>

  <br>GBGB have since stated that their industry-wide welfare contributions for licensed trainers during the coronavirus totalled “just over £240,000 for the month of April.” <br>

  <br>Despite the economic impact that the greyhound industry is facing currently, she says: “The industry will manage to come out of this one way or another.<br>

<br>“There are so many greyhounds waiting to be rehomed and too many unaccounted for. We want racing to end, but in a controlled manner.”<br>
